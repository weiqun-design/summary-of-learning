1. startproject
Syntax: scrapy startproject <project_name> [project_dir]

If project_dir wasn’t specified, project_dir will be the same as project_name.

2. crawl

Requires project: yes
Start crawling using a spider

3. check
Syntax: scrapy check [-l] <spider>
Requires project: yes
Run contract checks.

4. fetch
Syntax: scrapy fetch <url>
Requires project: no
Downloads the given URL using the Scrapy downloader and writes the contents to standard output.

5. view
Syntax: scrapy view <url>

Sometimes spiders see pages differently from regular users,
so this can be used to check what the spider “sees” and confirm it’s what you expect.
